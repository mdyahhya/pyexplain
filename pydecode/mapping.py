pyDecode Exception Mapping Module

This module contains a comprehensive mapping from every standard
Python exception and warning type to:
    - Simple 2–3 line beginner explanations (plain English + emoji)
    - One-line fix suggestion
    - Tags for quick filtering/classification
    - Optional rich media tokens ([IMG:], [AUDIO:])

Every mapping follows the format:
{
    "error_type": {
        "simple_explanation": "...",
        "fix_suggestion": "...",
        "tags": [...],
        "emoji": "⚠️",
        "rich": {"img": None, "audio": None}
    },
    ...
}
